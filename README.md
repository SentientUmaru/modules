Module Builder is ready so i will start pumping more modules out

-Masteranime has letters after their search names which i havent figured out how to fitler out

-animension.to, animedao.to, lite.animevibe.se, and 4anime.gg are good website's but will probably require regex so i wont be doing it

### The following is just personal notes as i learn about HTML (still a novice)
#### This is just for building the modules. Disregard if you think its for anything else.
CardDeck is a class so youâ€™d need to call it like this 

Line 9: getElement(\"ul.CardDeck\") 

So for classes you use the . Operator and for ids you use # (div#root for div id=root)
Make sure to use \ before quotes\

Example= a class="tip" href="https://chia-anime.su/anime/one-piece"
to (\"a.tip\") if needed to specify class
