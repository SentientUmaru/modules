# This is where i store and test my modules, most will probably not work.

### Current Modules
| WORKING | BROKEN |
| ------- | ------- |
| [GenoAnime](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SentientUmaru/modules/main/genoanime.json) | [AnimeHeaven](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SentientUmaru/modules/main/animeheaven.json)
| [AnimeRush2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SentientUmaru/modules/main/animerush2.json) | [AnimeRush](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SentientUmaru/modules/main/animerush.json)

### Testing Modules
#### There will be multiple Failed attempts and commits on these
| TESTING | DESCRIPTION |
| ------- | ------- |
| [AnimeRush2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SentientUmaru/modules/main/animerush2.json) | Sometimes MP4Upload links break on AnimeRush.json, So i will attempt to make a module that uses multilinks |
| [GenoAnimeT2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SentientUmaru/modules/main/genoanimeT2.json) | The Original version of this module is working fine |
| [7Anime](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SentientUmaru/modules/main/7anime.json) | |

Once i have a compiler i could use for these, a lot of them should go into the working category and allow me to add new ones.

Masteranime has letters after their search names which i havent figured out how to fitler out

animension.to, animedao.to, lite.animevibe.se, and 4anime.gg are good website's but will probably require regex so i wont be doing it

### The following is just personal notes as i learn about HTML (still a novice)
#### This is just for building the modules. Disregard if you think its for anything else.
CardDeck is a class so youâ€™d need to call it like this 

Line 9: getElement(\"ul.CardDeck\") 

So for classes you use the . Operator and for ids you use # (div#root for div id=root)
Make sure to use \ before quotes\

Example= a class="tip" href="https://chia-anime.su/anime/one-piece"
to (\"a.tip\") if needed to specify class
